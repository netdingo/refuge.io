        <h2>The refuge platform</h2>

        <p>Refuge connects data sources between machines and people,
        coming from devices, peoples or services in a decentralized
        manner. It does this by providing the following features:</p>

        </div>

        <h3 id="blob-server">Blob server</h3>

        <p>The blob server allows you to store any kind of data on
        multiple storage sources on the cloud, in your infrastructures
        or your disks. The storages sources can be
        synchronized in quasi-realtime easily.</p>

        <h3 id="index-service">The indexer</h3>

        <p>The index services will index datas from the storages servers
        by synchronizing them or transformation of them using a mapping
        system to an indexer (SQL, Fulltext Search, Geo, ...).

        <h3 id="decentralized">The P2P data platform</h3>

        <p>Coordinate multiple data sources coming from devices, peoples
        or services using hubs maintained by the community or by
        connecting directly between refuge nodes.</p>


        <p>The refuge platform allows you to share and retrieve your
        data by connecting directly to the other refuge nodes on the
        refuge platform.  Nodes can be discovered using GOSSIP or by
        connecting to an hub.</p>
