          <h2>refuge, the data social platform</h2>

          <p class="lead">Refuge connects data sources between machines and people, coming from
          devices, peoples or services in a decentralized manner.</p>


          <p>A number of individuals are collecting large amounts of data provided by
          environmental sensors or other sources. However, this data is too often
          underutilized by the greater community. The goal of this project is to
          build an open source tool that will allows to collect data and share
          them easily a distributed and decentralized manner.</p>
