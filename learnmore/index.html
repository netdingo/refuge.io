        <h2>refuge, the data social platform</h2>

        <p class="lead">Refuge connects data sources between machines and people, coming from
        devices, peoples or services in a decentralized manner.</p>


        <p>A number of individuals are collecting large amounts of data provided by
        environmental sensors or other sources. However, this data is too often
        underutilized by the greater community. The goal of this project is to
        build an open source tool that will allow to collect data and share
        them easily in a distributed and decentralized manner.</p>

            <h3>Data is yours</h3>
            <p>Your data is your own, share and store it on your terms. With
            refuge you can choose to store your data on the cloud or on your
            own infrastructure or disk. Then choose to share all, some or
            none of your it with others or the world at large.</p>

            <h3>Decentralized</h3>
            <p>Easily coordinate multiple data sources coming from
            devices, peoples or services through the P2P refuge platform
            using the refuge hubs provided by the community or by

            <h3>Connect</h3>
            <p>Build a true <em>Internet of things</em> by connecting
            your sensors, devices or any others data source to the
