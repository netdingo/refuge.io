          <p>The refuge box will act as a gateway for your data coming
          from devices, people or services. It will allow you to easily
          collect and store them and connect to other box and people
          around over the refuge box</p>

          <h3>But first, a refuge box prototype</h3>
          <p>While the refuge box still in development, we need your
          help. As always, we believe the best way to ensure that the
          right products are getting made is to let people try them out
          and then make changes as we go. We have designed a
          prototype that’s optimized for the refuge data platform. it’s also completely
          upgradable and open.</p>

          <p>In november 2013, we will release our first design. Keep
          posted!</p>
