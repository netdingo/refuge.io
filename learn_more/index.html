      <h1>refuge, the data social platform</h1>

      <p class="lead">Refuge connects data sources between machines and people, coming from
      devices, peoples or services in a decentralized manner.</p>


      <p>A number of individuals are collecting large amounts of data provided by
      environmental sensors or other sources. However, this data is too often
      underutilized by the greater community. The goal of this project is to
      build an open source tool that will allows to collect data and share
      them easily a distributed and decentralized manner.</p>
